# Custodian of Ore Game walkthrough:

**Level 8/9:**

- Best way to beat is to take it slow: destroy all enemies then heal to full health once you're safe.
- Make use of "Drone GPS Hack" to stop attack drones from coming towards you and so that missiles can't target you, then take them out with the machine gun
- Place down the magnet drone to anchor the package drone so it won't get blown away.
- All drones have 5HP, machine gun does 4DPS so time it right and you can get 3/4 drones in one cycle, plus a couple more with your airstikes.

**Level 10 (Boss):**

- Boss has 5 attacks that are picked at random: Guns, Missiles, Drones, Lightning, and Evade.
- Has 100HP, once you get it down to 50HP, it will do 2 of its 5 attacks at the same time.
- The attack drones can be stopped with the GPS hack, which will give you time to only kill them with missiles, leaving you to defeat the boss with just the machine gun in 5 cycles.
- **MAJOR SPOILER:** if you haven't spotted it, the bottom left corner is the safest place to anchor your drone since none of the boss attacks except the drones can get you there.
